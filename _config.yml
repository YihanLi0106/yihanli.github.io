  I recently graduated from Boston University's Mathematical Finance & Financial Technology program (Class of 2025). With a strong foundation in finance, programming, and quantitative analysis, I specialize in building data-driven financial models and strategies. My skills include Python, R, SQL, C++, and machine learning techniques, with applications in fix income, portfolio management, credit risk, deep learning, and algorithmic trading.
