**Project description:**  
This study explores innovative deep learning models for predicting option prices, leveraging tensor-based data representation and integrating CNN and RNN architectures. It highlights the superiority of these methods compared to traditional models like Black-Scholes (B-S) and standard LSTM, with experiments conducted on the Chinese market option dataset.

## 1. Research Objectives

1. Develop a novel tensor-based framework for representing financial data from multiple sources.
2. Propose deep learning models (CNN+RNN and Conv-LSTM) for handling 3D tensor data.
3. Evaluate the predictive performance of these models against traditional methods.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Tensor-based Information Framework

- Financial data is represented as a 3D tensor \(X_t \in \mathbb{R}^{I_1 \times I_2 \times I_3}\), capturing:
  - Fundamental data (e.g., spot price, strike price, implicit volatility).
  - Price-related data (e.g., settle price, price changes).
  - Option Greeks (e.g., Delta, Gamma, Vega).
  
This structure preserves correlations across different information modes but can result in sparse data, which the proposed models address.

### 2.2 Conv-LSTM Model

Conv-LSTM integrates convolutional operations with LSTM networks to capture spatiotemporal relationships in data. The equations for Conv-LSTM are:

$$
i_t = \sigma(W_{xi} \ast X_t + W_{hi} \ast H_{t-1} + W_{ci} \circ C_{t-1} + b_i)
$$

$$
f_t = \sigma(W_{xf} \ast X_t + W_{hf} \ast H_{t-1} + W_{cf} \circ C_{t-1} + b_f)
$$

$$
C_t = f_t \circ C_{t-1} + i_t \circ \tanh(W_{xc} \ast X_t + W_{hc} \ast H_{t-1} + b_c)
$$

$$
o_t = \sigma(W_{xo} \ast X_t + W_{ho} \ast H_{t-1} + W_{co} \circ C_t + b_o)
$$

$$
H_t = o_t \circ \tanh(C_t)
$$

Where:
- \( \ast \): Convolution operation.
- \( \circ \): Element-wise multiplication.
- \( i_t, f_t, o_t \): Input, forget, and output gates.
- \( C_t, H_t \): Cell state and hidden state.

### 2.3 CNN+RNN Model

This model combines convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction with RNNs (GRU) for temporal modeling. The workflow includes:

1. **Spatial Modeling**:  
   1D convolution with varying dilation rates to capture multi-scale spatial dependencies.

2. **Temporal Modeling**:  
   Bidirectional GRUs with hidden channels of sizes 8, 16, and 16, processing reshaped tensors of shape \((T, N, C \times D)\).

3. **Regression**:  
   A GRU unit followed by a fully connected layer to output the final predictions.

## 3. Experiment

### 3.1 Dataset
- Data Source: 50ETF options from April 2018 to June 2023.
- Training: 600 options (33,210 observations).
- Testing: 229 options (11,386 observations).

Data preprocessing included normalization:

$$
x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}, \quad \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i, \quad \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2
$$

## 4. Key Findings

1. **Model Comparison**:
   - Conv-LSTM (3C) achieved the best performance in MSE, RMSE, and MAE, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.

2. **Traditional Models**:
   - While the B-S model performed well in MAPE, it struggled with extreme price values.

3. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - Both CNN+RNN and Conv-LSTM outperformed LSTM and B-S in capturing spatiotemporal features.

## 5. Conclusions

Nowadays, deep learning is widely used in various fields, and it has become a hot topic in finance. In
this article, we propose a different data framework composed of information from different sources and improve the LSTM neural network. After that, we compare them with LSTM model and B-S
model in the empirical analysis. The result shows that the prediction ability of new models is better
than that of the traditional B-S model and LSTM model.

Artificial intelligence will have great application value in the financial field. The algorithmic
model based on the deep learning method does not need to build a complex mathematical model, yet
the prediction effect is more accurate. Deep learning in finance is reshaping the financial services
industry significantly. Applying state-of-art artificial intelligence methods in the financial field will
be of great importance in the future.
